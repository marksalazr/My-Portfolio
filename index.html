            <h2> My Story</h2>
            <p>  My journey in coding started in the Fall of 2022. 
                 Before that I was a Sailor in the Navy. My job was known as Aviation Ordnanceman it involed assembiling, loading and maintaining all missles, 
                 rockets and other explosives used on the different Navy Aircrafts!
                After almost 8 years of serving I opted to not re-enlist and decided to pursure a meaningful career in tech. 
                in short im glad to finally be out the military, however I am still very grateful for the experince and will forever remember 
                all the great folks I served with.
